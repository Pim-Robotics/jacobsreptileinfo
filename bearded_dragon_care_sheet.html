           <h1>1. Tank</h1>
           <p>Bearded dragons need at least a 40 gallon tank.  A good tank kit is the Thrive Front Double Door Opening Terrarium Desert Essentials Kit - 40 Gallon. It comes with the tank, carpet, heat lamps, food bowls, and a cave.</p>

           <br>
           <h1>2. Lighting and Heat Pad</h1>
           <p>Do not use the light bulbs that come with the kit. Use the Thrive Reptile Ceramic Heat Emitter and the Exo Terra Solar Glo (80 Watt). For a heat pad, get the  Zoo Med Repti Therm Reptile Under Tank Heater. Also get the Zoo Med Reptisun T5-Ho Terrarium Hood - 14".</p>

           <br>
           <h1>3. Decor</h1>
           <p>You should get some branches and a hammock for your bearded dragon to climb and bask on. It doesn't matter which ones you choose.</p>

           <br>
           <h1>4. Cricket Supplies</h1>
           <p>Bearded dragons eat live crickets, so you need the right supplies to take care of them. The things you need are EXO-TERRA Cricket Pen, Fluker's High-Calcium Cricket Diet, and Fluker's Orange Cube Complete Cricket Diet. You will also need Repashy Super Foods Calcium Plus Vitamin and Calcium Supplement to sprinkle on the crickets before you feed them to your bearded dragon.</p>

           <br>
           <h1>5. Food</h1>
           <p>Bearded dragons can eat crickets, dubia roaches, collard greens, mustard greens, bell peppers, butternut squash, hornworms, wax worms, and mealworms.</p>
           <img src="https://assets.petco.com/petco/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,t_ProductDetail-large/2732301-center-1"  height="500" width="50%">
           <br>
           <h1>6. The Lizard</h1>
           <p>Never get a bearded dragon at a big box pet store. They don't take good care of their lizards. Get your bearded dragon at a reptile show or a pet store that gets their bearded dragons from a breeder.</p>
