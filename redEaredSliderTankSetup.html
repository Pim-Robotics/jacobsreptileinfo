               <p>Red eared sliders make great pets, but you have to provide them with the right habitat. This article explains what red eared sliders need in their tank, a list of recommended supplies, and more.</p>
               <h2>Tank Size</h2>
               <p>Red-eared sliders need a large tank. The rule for turtle tank size is 10 gallons per one inch of the carapace (upper part of the shell). You can get a pond or glass aquarium, but glass aquariums are usually better because they take up less room. Baby red-eared sliders can live in 20 to 40-gallon tanks, but adult red-eared sliders will need a 65 gallon or more tank. Make sure that the turtle can completely turn around in the tank. Standard 55 and 65-gallon tanks are not wide enough for a turtle. A 75-gallon tank is best for most red-eared sliders. A good tank is the <a href="https://www.petsmart.com/fish/tanks-aquariums-and-nets/aquariums/marineland-majesty-aquarium-and-stand-ensemble-75-gallon-22101.html">Marineland Majesty 75 gallon tank</a>. It is big, and comes with a sturdy stand. Tanks with stands are great because you can store a ton of supplies and a canister filter in them. Getting the right tank for your turtle is extremely important.</p>
               <h2>Filter</h2>
               <p>Turtles are probably the most messy reptiles. They make a ton of waste, which is why you need to get a good filter. There are nine main types of filters; box filters, canister filters, Diatomic Filters, Fluidized Bed Filters, Power Filters, Sponge Filters, Trickle Filters, HOB filters, and Under Gravel Filter. Not all of these filters are good for turtles. The best types for turtles are; canister filters, HOB filters, and sponge filters. Canister filters are the strongest filters, so they are recommended for turtles. A durable and powerful canister filter is the Fluval canister filter. There are different models of it, so look at each one to see which one is good for your tank. You want to pick a filter that is meant for tanks twice the size as yours because it will clean up the tank more effectively. If you do not want a canister filter, read the article "<a href="https://www.jacobsreptileinfo.com/bestTurtleFilter.html">The Best Filters For Turtles</a>‚Äù for more filter options.</p>
               <h2>Heater and Thermometer</h2>
               <p>A heater is an important part of a red eared slider tank. It keeps the water warm so the turtle does not get sick. There are two types of heaters for turtles; inline and submersible. Submersible heaters are better for turtles because they are adjustable and more affordable than inline heaters. The best heater is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Aqueon-Aquarium-Heater-100W-Black/dp/B07JG9XKWK/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=aqueous+pro&qid=1614518632&sr=8-3">Aqueon Pro Adjustable Heater 100w</a>. It is completely smooth, so your turtle can not bite it. Get the right wattage for the tank. Look at the chart below to see what wattage heater to get. Set the heater between 75 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Any fish tank thermometer will work, but a good one is the Top Fin Digital Aquarium Thermometer. Never get a glass thermometer because your turtle could smash it and get hurt.</p>
               <img src="https://www.jacobsreptileinfo.com/aquariumHeaterSizeChart.png" height="50%" width="50%">
               <h2>Lighting</h2>
               <p>Red eared sliders need UVB lights to survive. Since red eared sliders are semi-aquatic, they need waterproof lights. A good waterproof UVB light is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zoo-Med-Aquatic-Turtle-Lighting/dp/B00CYDEARU/ref=sr_1_9?dchild=1&keywords=turtle+light&qid=1614518262&sr=8-9">Zoo Med Aquatic Turtle UVB Heat Lighting Kit</a>. Make sure to replace the lights every 10 months. You should set reminders on your phone to change it. Zoo Med has a helpful tool that emails you when you need to change your UVB lights (<a href="https://zoomed.com/uvb-reminder/">Here is the link</a>).</p>
               <h2>Lid</h2>
               <p>You should get a mesh lid for your turtle tank. Glass lids will not work because the UVB and heat from the lights can not travel through glass. You can get any mesh lid, but just make sure it is sturdy. Zilla screen lids and Fluker‚Äôs screen lids are good because they are made out of strong metal. You might have to cut the lid so the tubing from the canister filter can go into the tank.</p>
               <h2>Basking Platform</h2>
               <img src="https://www.jacobsreptileinfo.com/turtleOnFloatingDock.jpeg" width="50%">
               <p>Turtles need a basking platform to go on so they won't get shell rot or pneumonia. There are different types of basking platforms, but for the tank setup in this article, a floating basking platform is the best. Floating basking platforms are foam platforms that attach to the glass of a turtle tank using suction cups. A good floating basking platform is the <a href="https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/product/zoo-med-turtle-docks">Zoo Med Turtle Dock</a>. For bigger turtles, you might have to make some modifications to it so it won't sink. One way to make it not sink is to build a shelf or support post out of PVC pipes. If you do not want a floating basking platform, read the article ‚Äú<a href="https://www.jacobsreptileinfo.com/theBestBaskingPlatformForTurtles.html">The Best Basking Platform for Turtles</a>‚Äù for more basking platform options.</p>
               <h2>Water Care</h2>
               <p>Just like other aquatic animals, red eared sliders need their water dechlorinated. To do this you will need a water dechlorinator. Water dechlorinator removes unsafe chlorine from tap water to make it safe for your turtle. Turtles can survive without it, but it should be used so your turtle does not get hard water spots. A good water dechlorinator is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/API-CONDITIONER-Aquarium-Conditioner-32-Ounce/dp/B07BTMK89V/ref=sxts_sxwds-bia-wc-rsf-ajax1_0?cv_ct_cx=water+conditioner&dchild=1&keywords=water+conditioner&pd_rd_i=B07BTMK89V&pd_rd_r=c9b99ce3-3b42-4468-b5e4-bf09a369f284&pd_rd_w=fTyKd&pd_rd_wg=Fgj1N&pf_rd_p=5c711241-c674-4eef-b21c-fe6add670f33&pf_rd_r=05QXNTV8Q5YJ5CN4MCHJ&psc=1&qid=1614522447&sr=1-1-e30f047d-8e3c-4340-8179-6a77ce88d756">API TAP Water Conditioner</a>. This should be added after every water change. If you want, you can also use a waste remover. Waste removers help break down turtle waste, making your filter run more smoothly. There are many waste removers, but <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fluker-Labs-SFK43000-Natural-Reptile/dp/B071XJ6BR7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=flukers+eco+clean&qid=1614522541&s=pet-supplies&sr=1-1">Fluker‚Äôs Eco Clean</a> works the best.</p>
               <h2>List of Supplies</h2>
               <p>Here is a list of the supplies mentioned in this article. These are only the supplies for the tank.</p>
