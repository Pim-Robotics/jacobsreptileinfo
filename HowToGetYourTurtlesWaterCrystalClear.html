                       <p>  Have you been questioning why your turtle’s water is cloudy? This article will explain why the water is cloudy and a few ways to get your water crystal clear.</p>
                       <br>
                       <h3>Why the water is cloudy</h3>
                       <p>  As you probably know, turtles are extremely messy animals. Observe your turtle and see how many times it poops each day. If it is more than 2, you should take your turtle to a vet. You can also try modifying its diet. A diet with a lot of fruit can lead to stomach problems and your turtle pooping more than usual. If your turtle is having diarrhea, that is probably why your tank is cloudy. </p>

                       <h3>How to make the water crystal clear</h3>

                       <p>It is sometimes troublesome to get your turtle’s water crystal clear. Before buying anything to help the water get clear, do a deep clean on the tank. A deep clean is when you take out all of the water, scrub the glass, and rinse out the filter. This can be hazardous for the turtle if you don’t do it properly. Make sure to put in the appropriate amount of dechlorinator. Let the tank cycle for at least 20 minutes before putting the turtle back in. If you don’t already, you should do a deep clean once a month.
</p>
<p> If a deep clean does not work, you can try Fluker's Eco Clean. It helps break down waste and adds good bacteria to your filter. I have been using Fluker's Eco Clean for a year, and I have seen a difference. You can also use API Accu Clear. Even though it is mainly used for fish, it works wonderfully in turtle tanks. It helps bunch up the very small particles so they go up the filter faster. You should try Fluker’s Eco Clean or API Accu Clear before buying a new filter.

</p>
<p>
    If you have tried everything and the tank is still cloudy, you most likely need a new filter. There are 4 types of filters that are good for turtles; sponge filters, HOB filters, canister filters, and submersible filters. While all of these filters work well, canister filters are the best because they provide both biological and mechanical filtration. They are also the strongest and allow you to add your own media. Since turtles are extremely messy, they need a filter that is rated for double the amount of water that is in the tank. There are many canister filter brands, but the best ones are Fluval, Marineland, and Penn-Plax. Fluval filters are the most powerful and reliable (usually last for 10 years) but are also the most expensive. Marineland filters are not as powerful as Fluval filters but are much more affordable. Penn-Plax filters are as powerful as Marineland filters but do not last as long. If you can afford it, it is better to get a Fluval filter. If you do not want any of these filters, read the article “The Best Filters For Turtles” for more filter choices.
</p>
<p>
    Now you probably know the cause of your cloudy water. You can try a deep clean, Fluker’s Eco Clean, or API Accu Clear. If that doesn't work, try getting a canister filter.  It’s crucial that you keep your turtle’s water clear.
