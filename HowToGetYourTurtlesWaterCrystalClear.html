                       <p>Have you been questioning why your turtle’s water is cloudy? This article will explain why the water is cloudy and a few ways to get your water crystal clear.</p>
                       <br>
                       <h3>Why the water is cloudy</h3>
                       <p>As you probably know, turtles are extremely messy animals. Observe your turtle and see how many times it poops each day. If it is more than 2, you should take your turtle to a vet. You can also try modifying its diet. A diet with a lot of fruit can lead to stomach problems and your turtle pooping more than usual. If your turtle is having diarrhea, that is probably why your tank is cloudy. </p>

                       <h3>How to make the water crystal clear</h3>

                       <p>It is sometimes troublesome to get your turtle’s water crystal clear. Before buying anything to help the water get clear, do a deep clean on the tank. A deep clean is when you take out all of the water, scrub the glass, and rinse out the filter. This can be hazardous for the turtle if you don’t do it properly. Make sure to put in the appropriate amount of dechlorinator. Let the tank cycle for at least 20 minutes before putting the turtle back in. If you don’t already, you should do a deep clean once a month.
</p>
<p>If a deep clean does not work, you can try Fluker's Eco Clean. It helps break down waste and adds good bacteria to your filter. I have been using Fluker's Eco Clean for a year, and I have seen a difference. You can also use API Accu Clear. Even though it is mainly used for fish, it works wonderfully in turtle tanks. It helps bunch up the very small particles so they go up the filter faster. You should try Fluker’s Eco Clean or API Accu Clear before buying a new filter.

</p>
<p>If you have tried everything and the tank is still cloudy, you most likely need a new filter. Canister filters work the best for turtles because they are powerful and pick up a lot of waste. Any Fluval canister filter is the best choice for your turtle. They are the strongest and most reliable filter, but they are not cheap. They cost from $100 - $450 depending on the size of your tank. If you don’t want to spend that much, read my article The Best Filters For Turtles to find the right filter for you. If you choose to get a Fluval filter, to get your water very clear put Fluval Water Polishing Pads under the carbon and bio foam. It traps tiny particles to clear your water fast.

</p>
<p>
Now you probably know the cause of your cloudy water. You can try a deep clean, Fluker’s Eco Clean, or API Accu Clear. If that doesn't work, try getting a canister filter.  It’s crucial that you keep your turtle’s water clear.
