           <p>Crested geckos are the most popular gecko. They don’t need a lot of heating like bearded dragons do. They are easy to handle and don’t get as big as other geckos.</p>

           <h1>Tank setup</h1>
           <p>Enclosure: A ten gallon fish tank with a mesh lid is great for crested geckos. If you plan on having more than one in a tank, try to have 10 gallons per gecko.</p>
           <p>Substrate: Coconut fiber can be used as a substrate for crested geckos. You can also put in moss to help the humidity.</p>
           <p>Hiding place: Put artificial plants in the enclosure for your crested gecko to hide in.</p>
           <p>Water bowl: Place a shallow bowl of water in the tank to help the humidity level.</p>
           <p>Lighting: Put a UVA light above the enclosure.</p>
           <p>Tank cleaning: Replace the substrate every 2 weeks to keep the enclosure clean.</p>

           <h1>Diet</h1>
           <p>You can feed your crested gecko grapes, raspberries, strawberries, blackberries, blueberries, apples, figs, dates, plums once in a while. Also you should give them live crickets as their primary diet.</p>
