                <p>You can put crickets or dubia roaches in your tank for your bearded dragon to eat. If you don’t want bugs crawling around your tank, you can feed them in a container outside of the tank. Always put the lizard in the tank under the heat lamp right after you feed them because they can have trouble digesting if they get cold.</p>
