            <p>It is important to feed your bearded dragon the right foods. Baby bearded dragons eat about 80% bugs and 20% vegetables. Adults eat 20% bugs and 80% vegetables.</p>
            <br>
            <p>You should keep a salad bowl in your tank for your lizard to eat throughout the day. Look at the chart below to see what vegetables your bearded dragon can eat.</p>
            <br>
            <p>You should also feed your bearded dragon live insects every day. If your bearded dragon is less than 10 months old, feed it insects 2-3 times a day. If it is older than 10 months, feed it insects once a day. Always dust the bugs in calcium powder before giving it to your lizard. Look at the chart below to see what insects your bearded dragon can eat.</p>
