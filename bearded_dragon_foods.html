            <p>It is important to feed your bearded dragon the right foods. Baby bearded dragons eat about 80% bugs and 20% vegetables. Adults eat 20% bugs and 80% vegetables.</p>
            <br>
            <p>You should keep a salad bowl in your tank for your lizard to eat throughout the day. Look at the chart below to see what vegetables your bearded dragon can eat.</p>
            <br>
            <p>You should also feed your bearded dragon live insects every day. If your bearded dragon is less than 10 months old, feed it insects 2-3 times a day. If it is older than 10 months, feed it insects once a day. Always dust the bugs in calcium powder before giving it to your lizard. Look at the chart below to see what insects your bearded dragon can eat.</p>

                <p>You can put crickets or dubia roaches in your tank for your bearded dragon to eat. If you don’t want bugs crawling around your tank, you can feed them in a container outside of the tank. Always put the lizard in the tank under the heat lamp right after you feed them because they can have trouble digesting if they get cold.</p>
                <br>
