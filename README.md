My website about reptiles. This was the first major website I developed in mainly HTML, CSS, and javaScript during quarantine. The code is a mess, but I like to look back at it to see how I've progressed. Hosted using GitHub Pages. Visit it at <a href="https://www.jacobsreptileinfo.com" target="_blank">www.jacobsreptileinfo.com</a>
